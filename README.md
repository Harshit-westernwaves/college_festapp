# 🚀 Udaan - Official Fest Companion App

**Udaan** is the all-in-one digital companion for our annual college fest. This application serves as the central hub for students and attendees to navigate the three-day extravaganza, seamlessly bridging **Shrishti** (Days 1 & 2) and the grand finale, **Udaan** (Day 3).

Designed with a focus on user experience and a futuristic **Dark Mode & Neon** aesthetic, the app ensures attendees never miss a moment of the action.
